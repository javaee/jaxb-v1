Performance measurement framework.

<p>
	<em>This needs to be better documented.</em>


<p>
	The performance measurement framework is written as an extension to the unit test framework. This means that measurements are run as JUnit tests, and results are obtained through JUnit TestListener by looking for {@link PerformanceTest.ConfigTest}.
