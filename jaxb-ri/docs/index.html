    <p>
    Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) 
    provides an API and tools that automate the mapping between XML documents 
    and Java objects.</p>

    <p>
    JAXB makes XML easy to use by compiling an XML schema into one or more 
    Java technology classes. The combination of the schema-derived classes and 
    the binding framework enable developers to perform the following operations 
    on an XML document:</p><br/>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Unmarshal</b> XML content into a Java representation</li>
      <li><b>Access</b>, <b>update</b> and <b>validate</b> the Java representation 
          against schema constraints</li>
      <li><b>Marshal</b> the Java representation of the XML content into XML 
          content</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    JAXB gives Java developers an efficient and standard way of mapping between 
    XML and Java code. Java developers using JAXB are more productive because 
    they can write less code themselves and do not have to be experts in XML. 
    JAXB makes it easier for developers to extend their applications with XML and 
    Web Services technologies.</p>
