# Usage:
#   optit.sh <JVMopts>/<OptItOpts> <classname> <args> ...
# 
# This shell script can be used to launch a Java program with OptimizeIt.
# To use it,
#    1. launch your Java program with this.
#    2. open OptimizeIt GUI tool
#    3. wait for the program completion
#    4. attach OptimizeIt to the running session from the program menu.
#    5. stop the CPU profiler to obtain the profiling result
#
# This tool is primarily designed to be used in conjunction with the
# PerformanceTestRunner program (in test/src), so that one can manually
# investigate a particular performance measurement scenario deeper.
#
# Combined with setenv.sh, this shell script lets you launch OptimizeIt
# without going through a tedious classpath setting dialog of OptimizeIt.
