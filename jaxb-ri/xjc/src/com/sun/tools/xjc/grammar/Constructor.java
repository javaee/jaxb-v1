/**
 * Constructor declaration.
 * 
 * <p>
 * a constructor declaration consists of a set of fields to be initialized.
 * For example, if a class is defined as:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Class: Foo
 *   Field: String a
 *   Field: int b
 *   Field: BigInteger c
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Then a constructor declaration of {"a","c"} will conceptually
 * generate the following consturctor:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Foo( String _a, BigInteger _c ) {
 *   a=_a; c=_c;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * (Only conceptually, because Foo will likely to become an interface
 * so we can't simply generate a constructor like this.)
