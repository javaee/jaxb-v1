Changes since JAXB 1.0 FCS (JWSDP 1.1 FCS)
------------------------------------------

o Kohsuke 07.08.2003

  javadoc generation now includes source file name + line number
  where the schema fragment is taken from.

o Kohsuke 05.12.2003

  type-safe enum unmarshalling is made faster/more scalable.

o Kohsuke 03.13.2003

  changed the behaivor when @implClass is present. XJC continues to
  generate the default implementation class so that it will be readily
  sub-classed by an user-defined class.

o Kohsuke 03.10.2003

  type-safe enum were not generated as serializable even if the vendor
  extension is turned on. (bug #4827369)

o Kohsuke 02.28.2003

  added the "-catalog" option that enables Norm Walsh's entity resolver.

o Kohsuke 02.28.2003

  The XJC ant task is now capable of avoiding unnecessary re-compilation
  by comparing file timestamps. See the documentation for details.

o Kohsuke

  added the "-version" option to print out the XJC version.

o Kohsuke

  fixed a bug in mapping IDREF where XJC does too agressive optimization
  to determine the type of IDREF.
  
  Added a symbol space vendor extension customization to better restrict
  the type of IDREF.
  
  fixed bug 4817805: incorrect method signature generated for
  choiceContentProperty="true"
  
  added an ability to compress the schema fragment string by using gzip.
  this will automatically kick in when the schema fragment is larger than
  the threshold.

  RELAX NG support now has full external binding syntax support
  
  supported all name classes of RELAX NG (including <any> and <nsName>)
